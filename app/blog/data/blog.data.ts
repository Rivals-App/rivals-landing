          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">How RIVALS is Changing the Game</h2>

      "Global Landscape of Legal Skill-Based Wagering: A Comprehensive Analysis",
    excerpt:
      "A detailed look at the legal frameworks governing skill-based competitions worldwide.",

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">Global Landscape of Legal Skill-Based Wagering</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            Skill-based wagering, such as placing a $5 bet on a chess match, falls into a distinct legal category separate from chance-based gambling in many jurisdictions worldwide. This report examines the global distribution of countries that permit such wagers, the legal frameworks that govern them, and the various approaches to regulation across different regions.
          </p>
  
          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">Legal Framework and Classification Tests</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            The legality of wagering on games of skill hinges primarily on how jurisdictions classify and distinguish between games of skill and games of chance. Three predominant legal tests are applied globally to make this determination:
          </p>
  
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 24px;">The Three Classification Tests</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The approach used by a country largely determines whether skill wagers like a friendly chess bet are permitted:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><strong>Dominant Factor Test:</strong> Examines whether skill or chance is the primary determinant of the outcome. If skill predominantly influences results, wagering may be permitted.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><strong>Material Element Test:</strong> Considers whether chance plays any meaningful role in determining outcomes, regardless of skill involvement. More restrictive than the Dominant Factor test.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><strong>Any Chance Test:</strong> The strictest standard, where any element of chance—no matter how minor—classifies the activity as gambling rather than a skill game.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            Countries applying the Dominant Factor test are more likely to permit skill wagers, while those using the Any Chance test generally prohibit them.
          </p>
  
          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">Confirmed Countries Allowing Skill Wagers</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            Based on the available data, several countries have been confirmed to permit wagering on games of skill in some capacity:
          </p>
  
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 24px;">European Countries</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            Europe represents the largest concentration of countries with legal frameworks explicitly allowing skill-based wagers:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Romania, Spain, and Sweden all permit real-money skill gaming.
          </p>
  
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 24px;">Restricted European Approaches</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Several European countries allow skill games but with significant limitations:</p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            France, Portugal, and Italy allow skill games but restrict them to virtual "play" money rather than real currency wagers.
          </p>
  
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 24px;">North America</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">The United States presents a complex picture with significant variation by state:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Skill wagers are not prohibited at the federal level</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Approximately 38 states permit skill-based wagering with varying regulations.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">States like Arizona, Connecticut, Arkansas, Florida, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, South Carolina, Montana, Tennessee, and South Dakota require compliance with specific laws to collect monetary prizes.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Indiana and Maine prohibit real prizes for card-based skill games</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 24px;">Asia</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Regulation varies significantly across Asian countries:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">India generally allows skill-based games while prohibiting games of chance, though regulations vary substantially by state.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">The Supreme Court of India ruled that horse racing betting is a game of skill, not chance, in the case of Dr. K.R. Lakshmanan v. State Tamil Nadu.</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">Global Distribution Analysis</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            The distribution of countries allowing skill wagers shows a clear concentration in certain regions:
          </p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Europe represents 88.2% of countries with confirmed legal skill wagering</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">North America and Asia each represent 5.9% of the distribution</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            This distribution reflects both regional attitudes toward skill-based competition and the maturity of regulatory frameworks addressing such activities.
          </p>
  
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 24px;">Legal Status Breakdown</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">Of countries with confirmed information about skill wagers:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">12 countries have fully legal frameworks for skill wagers</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">3 countries have restricted frameworks (allowing only virtual currency)</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">2 countries have varying regulations by state/region</li>
          </ul>
  
          <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 24px;">Estimated Global Coverage</h3>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;">While precise country-by-country data is incomplete, some sources provide broader estimates:</p>
          <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; padding-left: 1.5em; list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">One source claims skill games with prizes can be legally offered in approximately "80% of the world".</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">However, this estimate likely includes jurisdictions where such activities fall into legal gray areas rather than having explicit legal frameworks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            The lack of comprehensive global data makes an exact count difficult, but based on confirmed information, at least 17 countries have explicit legal frameworks addressing skill wagers (including those with restrictions), with the actual global number likely higher.
          </p>
  
          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">Conclusion</h2>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            The legal landscape for skill-based wagering varies significantly worldwide, with Europe leading in explicit frameworks permitting such activities. The United States and India also allow skill wagers in most regions, albeit with complex state-by-state variations.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            While the exact global count of countries permitting skill wagers remains difficult to determine with precision, the available evidence suggests that at least 17 countries have explicit legal frameworks addressing skill-based wagering. Many more likely permit such activities either through legal gray areas or through the absence of prohibitive legislation.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            For individuals seeking to engage in small-scale skill wagers, such as a $5 chess bet, it's important to note that local regulations may differ from national frameworks, and enforcement attitudes toward small-scale, private wagers often differ from commercial skill gaming operations.
          </p>

          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">Rivals wins Google HQ Pitch Day, securing overall victory at Kickstart Global's Founders Under 24 Summit</h2>
          
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            Rivals has been named the overall winner of Kickstart Global's Founders Under 24 Summit, hosted at Google's London headquarters. The event, backed by Google Cloud and Fund iQ, brought together 42 venture-backed and university-founded start-ups. Judges, drawn from sector-specialist venture capital firms, operator mentors, and Google's own start-up team, awarded Rivals the highest aggregate score for product-market fit, technical execution, and compliance readiness.
          </p>
          
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">
            "Delivering a functional MVP in less than a fortnight shows the calibre of talent behind Rivals and the urgency of the problem they are solving," one judge remarked after the final round.
          </p>
          
          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">A thirteen-day build, a live demo in the room</h2>
          
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            Barely two weeks before the Summit, Rivals existed only as a detailed business plan and pitch deck. Guided by advisors at Founden.xyz, Founder & CEO Manraj Sandhu formed a dedicated product squad, compressing a typical sprint cycle into a 13-day marathon to deliver a working minimum-viable product.
          </p>
          
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            On stage, the team demonstrated real-time staking and instant-settlement leaderboards by handing pre-configured phones to the audience—inviting them to compete in a live round of Noughts and Crosses. Each move appeared on a rooftop-latency leaderboard projected behind the presenters, underscoring the platform's ability to process micro-transactions in milliseconds.
          </p>
          
          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            To amplify foot-traffic at the demo booth, the team produced branded apparel and miniature billboards, translating physical curiosity into on-device engagement, an approach that resonated with the event's Gen-Z-heavy audience while remaining firmly within Rivals' compliance framework.
          </p>
          
          <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0.8em; font-size: 30px;">Why it matters</h2>

          <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
            For this round, Founder & CEO Raj Sandhu reframed the narrative: rather than leading with instant-settlement infrastructure, he highlighted the passion of the gaming communities that fuel Rivals—and the Kickstart network that convened the finalists. The message resonated:
